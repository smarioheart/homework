## PROBLEM
At the Chronicle, we recently took a step back to reevaluate the effectiveness of our job board & networking site, ChronicleVitae (www.chroniclevitae.com). The job search functionality on ChronicleVitae was buried and difficult to find for a first time visitor. According to our analytics, most of our traffic comes through Google by searching “Chronicle jobs.” We wanted to cater our site to jobseekers.

## PROCESS
I looked through our previous research (recent users tests on Chroniclevitae.com and customer interviews) to distill some key themes regarding the current use of our site and how it functioned in comparison to our competitors. I also analyzed the most common paths to ChronicleVitae.com using Google Analytics.

Our users craved an easier way to get to job listings. The current state of our homepage (which hadn’t been updated since launch in 2012) was marketing copy, flashy graphics, but not much indication that ChronicleVitae was a tool for jobseekers.

After analyzing our research, I determined our key themes were that users wanted easier access to jobs, clarification of the ChronicleVitae brand, and more up-to-date info about what their colleagues were reading or doing.

I got to work on sketching and wireframing, testing various solutions that would surface some of our valuable functionality while also clearly demonstrating that Vitae was part of The Chronicle’s trustworthy brand. I worked with a team of designers, developers, digital marketers, and other stakeholders to develop these wireframes throughout an iterative process. Once we felt comfortable with the wireframes, I handed them over to our graphic designer and collaborated her with on a daily basis to build out the full visual design of the site. We followed a similar process during the dev cycle to complete the build out of the new ChronicleVitae homepage found at www.chroniclevitae.com.
